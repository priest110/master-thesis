\label{ref:chapter_2}

This chapter introduces the state of the art of this dissertation, which is divided between two sections: background and related work.

Firstly, we provide an overview of the use of \gls{dms}s, as well as their different models and approaches. Furthermore, we provide a contextualisation regarding the case study under consideration, describing its particularities. Finally, we discuss the different criteria for evaluating a \gls{sdms} as a response to the problem of scientific data management.

Secondly, we thoroughly analyse each of the three systems considered in this work, that is, \textit{\gls{ckan}} \citep{ckn}, \textit{\gls{eudat}} \citep{eud} and \textit{Magda} \citep{mgd}, and subsequently we perform an evaluation and comparison between them to understand which is best suited for managing scientific data, with special attention to our case study.
