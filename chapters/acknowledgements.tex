Throughout the writing of this dissertation, I have received a great deal of support and assistance.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Professor José Orlando Pereira. Without his guidance and assistance throughout the process, the outcome of this dissertation would not be the same.

While doing this work, I had a Research Grant from INESC TEC funded by National Funds, so I also want to thank FCT (Fundação Portuguesa para a Ciência e Tecnologia) and INESC TEC. In particular, a word of thanks to Susana Barbosa, researcher at INESC TEC and one of the coordinators of the SAIL Project, her assistance was invaluable.

To my family, I would like to express my deep gratitude for always being there and for always supporting me throughout my academic journey, providing everything I needed. Certainly, without them, these last five years would not have been possible.

A special thanks to my friends, in particular those who have lived this experience closely, they have made all the effort rewarding. These five years will always be remembered for the beautiful stories we lived together.

The last word of appreciation goes to my dear Lídia, for her unconditional support at all times. I am thankful that she appeared on this journey and never let me down. Thank you for always encouraging me to be the best version of myself.
