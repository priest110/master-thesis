\label{ref:chapter_3}

This chapter covers the solution developed for the problem presented in this thesis, from how it is implemented, addressing the particularities of the case study and its data, to the obstacles encountered and the improvements made to the \textit{\gls{ckan}} base system.

After the definition of \textit{\gls{ckan}} as the system to be adopted, the investigation of the functionalities to be considered for the \gls{sail} Project had a new contribution from its team, who informed us about the key elements to be considered in the elaboration of the system, taking into account the nature and usability of the data:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Understand how best to organize the data;
      \item View data geographically;
      \item Filter the data geographically;
      \item Restrict content according to user type;
      \item Seek to integrate \textit{\gls{eudat}}, more specifically the \textit{B2FIND} service.
  \end{enumerate}
