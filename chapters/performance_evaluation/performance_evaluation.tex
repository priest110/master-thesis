\label{ref:chapter_4}

  In order to understand how the system behaves in a real-world context, especially to extrapolate its behavior on a large-scale system with thousands of requests per second, we need to understand how the system works in a much smaller, controlled world. To this end, we performed tests to obtain the server execution profile and, in this section, we will explain the test conditions, the methodology used, and the results we obtained from our adapted \textit{\gls{ckan}} system.
